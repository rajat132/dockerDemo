To create a sample demo angular project to run on docker I followed below steps:
1)	Installed angular cli using following command: sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
2)	Create working directory for the project.
3)	Ran following command inside working directory to generate angular application: sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
4)	Updated app.component.ts and app.component.html to display my desired title of the homepage.
5)	Then I went inside the folder created by angular and created Dockerfile to docarize this app.
6)	Since we have to use docker-compose to manage and build the project I used following command to install docker-compose: sudo apt install docker-compose
7)	Then I created docker-compose.yml file to build docker image from source code and map port 80 of docker container to 8800 of my local machine.
8)	Then I used following command to build and run the application: docker-compose up --build
